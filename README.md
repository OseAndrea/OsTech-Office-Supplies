It's been a couple of months since my data analysis course. I am revisiting my lessons this month, and I am starting with a simple Excel dashboard using a fictional data set from Contextures Excel Tips Website.

---

This analysis focuses on a company and the amount and total cost of units sold from 2021 through 2022. With this dataset, I worked with pivot tables and corresponding charts, deriving insights and giving recommendations based on the data set.

_Disclaimer: The data set used in this analysis is a dummy dataset and does not represent any company or organization._

## Problem Statement
This analysis aims to discover the following:

* The total sales per year
* The total sales per region
* The most expensive and cheapest items
* The items that bring in the most and least profit
* The best sales rep in each region

## Data Sourcing
I downloaded the data set from Contextures Excel Tips Website as a CSV file.

## Data Transformation
I inspected the data set and found it free of errors. However, I formatted the data set as a table and the columns into appropriate units.
